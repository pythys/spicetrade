## Description

   Colonize Europe!

   Start from nothing and dominate another continent.
   Spread the influence of your culture while creating your own empire!

   Since the 14th century, Europe has been a global super power when it
   started colonizing other continents. But what if history had gone a
   different way? What would Europe be like if Asia had prevailed?

   Abu Al-Qazzaz is the main character in Spice Trade. He is a poor young
   man from Baghdad, who has inherited a house and some land, and he wants
   to get married too.

   Abu decides to try his luck in the spice game. He has to prevent the
   European countries from gaining a trade monopoly. Will Abu be able to
   beat out the Europeans in the spice trade?
   Could Europe have been different?
   How? You decide!
