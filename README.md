## General

   Colonize Europe!

   Start from nothing and dominate another continent.
   Spread the influence of your culture while creating your own empire!

   Since the 14th century, Europe has been a global super power when it
   started colonizing other continents. But what if history had gone a
   different way? What would Europe be like if Asia had prevailed?

   Abu Al-Qazzaz is the main character in Spice Trade. He is a poor young
   man from Baghdad, who has inherited a house and some land, and he wants
   to get married too.

   Abu decides to try his luck in the spice game. He has to prevent the
   European countries from gaining a trade monopoly. Will Abu be able to
   beat out the Europeans in the spice trade?
   Could Europe have been different?
   How? You decide!

## Revival Initiative

   This game almost went out of existence and the original website spicetrade.org
   went offline. Thankfully the maintainer had a copy of the original source code
   which was upgraded to more modern versions of Java and now people can continue
   to enjoy this game.

   This initiative was taken because otherwise that game would no longer exist in
   source code form, and hence never have the ability to fix bugs and make
   improvements.
