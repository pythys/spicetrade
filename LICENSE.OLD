2. Description

    Colonize Europe!

    Start from nothing and dominate another continent.
    Spread the influence of your culture while creating your own empire!

    Since the 14th century, Europe has been a global super power when it 
    started colonizing other continents. But what if history had gone a 
    different way? What would Europe be like if Asia had prevailed?

    Abu Al-Qazzaz is the main character in Spice Trade. He is a poor young 
    man from Baghdad, who has inherited a house and some land, and he wants 
    to get married too.

    Abu decides to try his luck in the spice game. He has to prevent the 
    European countries from gaining a trade monopoly. Will Abu be able to 
    beat out the Europeans in the spice trade?
    Could Europe have been different?
    How? You decide!

5. Tools and technology

    The following third party technologies (libraries) were used in building 
    the game engine (many thanks to all parties):

    Java and AWT - http://java.sun.com
    - The game is done as a Java application, using the AWT drawing routines.

    XStream - http://xstream.codehaus.org/
    - The game data is stored as XML, which is loaded by using XStream, done 
      by Joe Walnes.

    XML Pull Parser - http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/
    - The game also uses XML Pull Parser, done by Aleksander Slominski, to speed 
      up the XML parsing.

    BeanShell - http://www.beanshell.org/
    - Another technology used in the game is BeanShell, done by Pat Niemeyer, 
      that allows for arbitrary Java code to be executed (eval) within context.

    Tritonus - http://www.tritonus.org/
    - Tritonus is an implementation of the Java Sound API and is used in the 
      game together with JOrbis to provide the Ogg Vorbis support.

    JOrbis - http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/
    - JOrbis is a pure Java Ogg Vorbis decoder from JCraft and together with 
    Tritonus, enables the game to use Ogg Vorbis format sound, which is good 
    because the origianl WAV format files took 500Mb.

    And these are the tools:

    Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/
    - The game has been developed using the Eclipse IDE.

    Ant - http://ant.apache.org/
    - Packaging the game into a JAR file has been done using an Ant build script.

    Lotus Notes - http://www.ibm.com/
    - All the XML in the game has been edited with a Lotus Notes application 
      created specifically for the task.


6. The end

    Thanks to everyone and hope you enjoy the game :-)
